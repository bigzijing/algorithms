# Algorithms

This is a repository that contains my solutions and workings for miscellaneous algorithm/coding exercises, i.e. Grind75, Leetcode, Advent of Code, etc, etc.

File repository would be like so:

```bash
├── dir (i.e. grind75/AoC/leetcode)
│   ├── difficulty_exercise1
│   │   ├── README.md
│   │   ├── scala_question1.sc
│   │   └── python_question1.py
│   └── difficulty_exercise2
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── scala_question2.sc
│       └── python_question2.py
└── README.md (this file)
```

- exercises would be named by their name, prefixed by their difficulty (if it exists)
- README.md will contain the link to the exercise as well as the question itself
- scala_question.sc will be a Scala script that can be run using [ammonite REPL](https://ammonite.io/) via the command `amm scala_question.sc`
- python_question.py will be a Python script that can be run using the python REPL
